Lecture 1:
Fetch for the auth API::
In order to integrate the auth API endpoints from the server with the frontend React
components, we will add methods for fetching sign-in and sign-out API endpoints in
the client/auth/api-auth.js file.

Sign-in::
--The signin method will take user sign-in data from the view component, then use
fetch to make a POST call to verify the user with the backend.
---The component invoking this method
needs to handle the response appropriately, such as storing the received JWT locally
so it can be used when making calls to other protected API routes from the frontend.

Sign-Out::
--signout uses fetch to make a GET
call to the signout API endpoint on the server.

***With these API fetch methods added, the React frontend has complete access to the
endpoints we made available in the backend.
