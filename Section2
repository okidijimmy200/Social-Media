Lecture 1:
Following users in MERN Social::
--In MERN Social, users will be able to follow each other. Each user will have a list of
followers and a list of people they follow and also see a list of users they can follow

Following and unfollowing:
--In order to keep track of which user is following which other users, we will have to
maintain two lists for each user. When one user follows or unfollows another user, we
will update one's following list and the other's followers list.

Updating the user model:
To store the list of following and followers in the database, we will need to
update the user model with two arrays of user references,

--These references will point to the users in the collection being followed by or
following the given user.

Lecture 2:
Adding APIs to follow and unfollow::
--When a user follows or unfollows another user from the view, both users' records in
the database will be updated in response to the follow or unfollow requests.

--The addFollowing controller method in the user controller will update the
following array for the current user by pushing the followed user's reference into
the array

Lecture 3:
Accessing the follow and unfollow APIs in views::
--update the api-user.js file with follow and unfollow methodds

Lecture 4:
Follow and unfollow buttons::
---The button that will allow a user to follow or unfollow another user will appear
conditionally, depending on whether the user is already followed or not by the
current user,

The FollowProfileButton component::
---We will create a separate component for the follow button called
FollowProfileButton, wch will show the folow and unfollow btn depending on whether the current user is already
a followe of the user in the profile

--When FollowProfileButton is added to the profile, the following value will be
determined and sent from the Profile component as a prop to
FollowProfileButton, along with the click handler that takes the specific follow
or unfollow fetch API to be called as a parameter

Updating the Profile component::
--In the Profile view, FollowProfileButton should only be shown when the user
views the profile of other users,
